## Hi there üëã

My name is Adam and I'm a software developer. I'm a big fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Node.js and Vue.js. I'm currently working at [AppUnite](https://appunite.com) as a frontend developer. I'm open to new technologies and solutions, and always willing to learn new things.
My main focuses right now are broadening my knowledge beyond the JavaScript world, and trying to dive into a completely new platform - like iOS.

### Nice projects and contributions:

- [Require Podcast](https://require.podcast.gq) - My podcast about JavaScript and web development:
  - [Website](https://github.com/requirepodcast/website) - Our website, made with Gatsby.js, with data sourced from Markdown files from [episodes](https://github.com/requirepodcast/episodes) repo
  - [require('letter')](https://github.com/requirepodcast/letter) - Webpage for our newsletter, made using Next.js. Has some serverless functions for registering and sending a welcome email, and for connecting our CMS (Contentful) with our mail provider - Sendgrid.
  - [App](https://github.com/requirepodcast/app) - Official app for listening to the podcast, made with React Native. 
  - [studio](https://github.com/requirepodcast/studio) - Web app for us to easily render episodes for YouTube using ffmpeg, generate promotional images and control our permalinks, deployed using Docker on Microsoft Azure. Currently working on solution based off this, which'll be able to work with any podcast and be easily deployable
