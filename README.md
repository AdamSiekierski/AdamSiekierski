## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam and I'm a software developer. I'm a big fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I'm currently working at [AppUnite](https://appunite.com) as a full-stack developer, mostly with React and Elixir (Phoenix). I'm open to new technologies and solutions, and always willing to learn new things.
My main focuses right now are broadening my knowledge beyond the JavaScript world, going deeper into Elixir and maybe trying some mobile platforms in the future? ðŸ¤”
